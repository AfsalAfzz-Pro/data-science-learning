1. **Matrix Multiplication:**


* Matrix multiplication is an operation defined between two matrices, where the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix for the operation to be valid.

2. **Dot Product:**
* The dot product is an operation defined between two vectors (arrays). If _u_ and v are two vectors of the same length _n_, then their dot product is (_u_ â‹… _v_).
